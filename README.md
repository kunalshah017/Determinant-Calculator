# Determinant-Calculator

This repository contains a C++ code that calculates the determinant of 2x2 and 3x3 matrices, and can also provide the co-factor, adjoint, and inverse matrices of a given determinant. 

## Usage
To run this code, you can either clone the repository and compile it on your local machine or use the online compiler [here](https://onlinegdb.com/Nq1d0qksi).

## Matrix Operations
The following matrix operations are supported by this code:
- Calculation of 2x2 and 3x3 determinants
- Calculation of the co-factor matrix
- Calculation of the adjoint matrix
- Calculation of the inverse matrix

## Matrix Visualization
Check out this cool visualization of matrix operations inspired by the Matrix Trilogy:
